## russianroulette-python

A Russian Roulette written in Python for Android and Windows. You may need to start the file from administrator (for Windows) or have a rooted device (for Android). This project of mine may be updated, but idk when.

Also I'm new at coding, so if there's something wrong, please, email me (aridelovesinternet@gmail.com) with your bug report or send it to my bot (https://t.me/nightcordryzenbot)
